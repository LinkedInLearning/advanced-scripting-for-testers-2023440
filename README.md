## Course Description

## Instructions
You will find the various scripts for this course in the numbered sub-folders. There is a subfolder in there for each video that has scripts available. So for example to find the scripts for video 5 from chapter 1, you would go to the [01_05 folder](./01_05)

It is reccommended that you try all exercises on your own before looking at the scripts. The scripts are provided as a way to check or debug your work, but you will have the greatest advances in your learning if you try to work through the examples on your own first!
